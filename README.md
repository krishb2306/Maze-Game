# Maze-Game

Welcome to Maze King. It's a simple game where you have to solve 11 mazes in the shortest time possible. I went with a more retro style theme, which includes a linear gradient for the background. Once you open the app, you can open the instructions which tells you how to play and a key to certain buttons in the game. Once you press start you will move to the game screen where you can press "Begin" to start the timer and game. Until you press "Begin" everything is disabled.

As you play you can tilt your phone or use the manual buttons by tapping on the "eye". You can reset the position of your player to the start with the "reset" button and you can pause the game by pressing "pause".

The "pause" menu will show you all the level you have beaten and the time interval for them. Once you finish the game a "Game Over" screen will show, will 
your total time, level times, and a button to view "All Times". The All Times screen will show you all the times you have finished the game. 

The game is compatible with Android and IOS, even the tilting feature.
